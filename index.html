		Select the sentence you want to practice and press 'Start Shadow Boxing' to begin.
		<br>
		To play the recordings, just press 'play'. There are three types of exercises:
		<br>
		1. Listening - Listen to the whole sentence. Don't worry about speaking at this point. Just try to get a feel for how the sentence sounds. Read over the sentence and translation and look out for any words that you don't know. Both an idiomatic and word-for-word translation are provided.
		<br>
		2. Words - Practice saying the individual words. Try to speak in unison with the recording, imitating the sounds, tones, and rhythm as closely as possible.
		<br>
		3. Piecing it Together - You will practice building the entire sentence, with one word added at a time.
		<br>
		<br>
		I recommend doing each exercise for at least 10 repetitions for maximum effectiveness, but you can practice fewer times if you wish. When you finish the exercise, press 'continue' to move on to the next exercise. If you want to skip a exercise, just press 'skip'.
		<br>
		<br>
		Continue practicing until you can say the sentence with perfect pronunciation, rhythm and intonation. You may want to repeat the lesson over the course of several days.

	<strong>What is Shadowing?</strong>
		<br><br>
	Shadowing is a highly effective technique for learning a foreign language, created by the legendary polyglot Alexander Arguelles. The process is simple: listen to a recording in a foreign language, and speak along with it, imitating the sounds you are hearing as accurately as possible.

	<strong>What is Shadow Boxing?</strong>
		<br><br>
	Shadow Boxing facilitates shadowing by breaking up a sentence into the simplest components - words and short phrases (boxes), allowing you to practice and master them individually before recombining them into a whole. Shadow Boxing allows you to rapidly improve your accent and increase your fluency in a foreign language with minimal difficulty.
